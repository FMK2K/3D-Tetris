**Tetris 3D Project**

This project was a collaborative effort for the Intro to Computer Science course (COSC 112) at Amherst College. Our goal was to implement the classic game of Tetris in a fully 3D environment, utilizing the mathematical Rotation Matrix to handle the rotation of Tetrimino pieces.

**Project Description**
Tetris 3D brings the beloved 2D puzzle game into a three-dimensional space. Players manipulate Tetrimino pieces composed of four blocks each, aiming to complete full layers to clear them and earn points. The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses, with pieces falling faster over time.

**Key Features**
3D Rendering: The game is displayed in a fully 3D environment, providing a modern twist to the classic Tetris gameplay.
Rotation Matrix: We implemented the mathematical Rotation Matrix to accurately rotate the Tetrimino pieces in three dimensions, ensuring smooth and precise gameplay.

**User Interface:**
An intuitive interface allows players to control the game using keyboard inputs to move, rotate, and drop pieces.

**Scoring System:**
The game features a scoring system that rewards players for completing layers and performing advanced moves.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Java 
Graphics Library: JavaFX 
Mathematical Tools: Rotation Matrix for handling 3D rotations
